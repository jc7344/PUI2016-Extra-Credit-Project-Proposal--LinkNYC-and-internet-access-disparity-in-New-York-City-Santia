**Analysis:**
All the data wrangling will be done with python. Unnecessary values will be dropped and datasets will be merged and/or aggregated according to the purpose of the project. In order to better communicate exiting conditions, I will perform reverse geocoding to obtain zip codes from latitude/longitude locations (for all spatial data) and I will plot them both against broadband access levels. I will also create a 1/2mile buffer around kiosks and analysis linear distance between residents and links.
