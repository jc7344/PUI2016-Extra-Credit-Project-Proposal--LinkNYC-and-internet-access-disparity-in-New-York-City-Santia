**Problem Description:**
In light of the increasingly documented digital divide, and motivated by the most recent policy brief published by the Office of the New York City Comptroller, the purpose of my project is to analyze existing conditions (in terms of household broadband access) and the current disposition of LinkNYC kiosks (“Links”) throughout the city. Given the fact that Mayor Bill de Blasio conceived the installation of more than 7,000 links as a self-funded strategy to tackle the so called internet disparity across the five boroughs, my project aims to determine whether or not the initial installation sites were chosen based on the needs for the “unconnected” and also, if the current placement of kiosks accentuates the broadband access disparity. Lastly, and as a way to look forward, I will review future LinkNYC locations and, hopefully, determine if the public/private partnership will prioritize New Yorkers lacking access to the internet.
