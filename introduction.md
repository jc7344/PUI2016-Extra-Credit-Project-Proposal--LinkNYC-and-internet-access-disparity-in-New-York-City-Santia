**Data:**
The nature of my project is divided in three dimensions: 1) a spatial analysis regarding the proximity to LinkNYC for all New Yorkers; 2) a correlation between broadband access and LinkNYC locations, and 3) a correlation between household income, internet access and proximity to kiosks (depending on the mapping method).

**Is the current disposition of LinkNYC kiosks contributing to the increasing internet access disparity in the city?**


1)	Total Population (Tabular-ACS 2009-2012 estimates) by census tract (Spatial-Bytes of the Big Apple), LinkNYC locations (Tabular-NYC open data), MapPLUTO (spatial-Bytes of the Big Apple)

2)	Internet Use (Tabular-ACS 2014 estimates) by census tract and LinkNYC locations.

3)	Poverty (ACS 2009-2012 estimates) by census tract and LinkNYC locations (hopefully on GIS, by spatial join, buffer and proximity analysis)

4)Mean income in the past 12 months(in 2014 inflation-adjusted dollars)-ACS 2012 five year estimate
