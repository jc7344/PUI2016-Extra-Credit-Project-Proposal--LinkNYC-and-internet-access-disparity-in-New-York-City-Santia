# Introduction

The format of this template follows the typical journal publication which includes an **abstract** for summarizing the article, an **introduction**, **results** and **conclusion**. Examples of an **equation**, **list** and **citation** are also included.

## The purpose of the introduction

Most academic introductions follow an ‘inverted pyramid’ structure: they start broad and narrow down to a specific thesis or research question.

The introduction should reveal:
  1. some broad knowledge of the overall topic
  2. references to related and prior work in the field of investigation
  3. succinct overview of the major point of the paper.
