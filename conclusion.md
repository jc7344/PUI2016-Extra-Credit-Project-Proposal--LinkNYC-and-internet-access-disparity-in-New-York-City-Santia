**References:**
As it was mentioned earlier, the current disparity in internet access will be analyzed based on the latest policy paper published by the office of the Comptroller. Additionally, and as way to provide a context, I will examine Martin Lehofer’s paper on platforms for smart cities and OECD-funded studies about high-speed and municipal networks. Finally, I will review Mayor de Blasio’s public announcements regarding the role of LinkNYC in decreasing internet access disparity in the city. 

**Deliverable:**
The result of my analysis will be presented as a policy recommendation both for community and municipal leaders. My intention is to translate technical language into succinct information in order to facilitate decision-making and promote participatory planning in the City.
