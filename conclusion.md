**References:**
As it was mentioned earlier, the current disparity in internet access will be analyzed based on the latest policy paper published by the office of the Comptroller. Additionally, and as way to provide a context, I will examine Martin Lehofer’s paper on platforms for smart cities and OECD-funded studies about high-speed and municipal networks. Finally, I will review Mayor de Blasio’s public announcements regarding the role of LinkNYC in decreasing internet access disparity in the city. 

**Deliverable:**
As deliverables for my project, I will submit a statistical result which will be produced after performing a z-test. Additionally, I will include various plots, tables and graphs supporting the result of my analysis and the possible rejection of the Null Hypothesis. Lastly, I will deliver a map displaying both a spatial diagnosis of existing conditions and the future locations of LinkNYC kiosks. My intention is to translate technical language into succinct information in order to facilitate decision-making and promote participatory planning in the City.
